# Employee Tracker 

## Summary 
It can be such a head ache keeping track of your staff. Just hire someone new? An employee just accepted a new role? There's no way someone can keep track of all that by themselves. Now with this employee tracker, you'll be able to view all available departments, roles, and employees as well as adding new roles, employees and departments. 

## Installation 
In your command line run: 
> npm i 
> 
to install the necessary dependencies. Also make sure you have a MySql account! 

Once you're in MySql, run: 
> - mysql -u root -p  (You'll be prompted for your password)
> - Once that's complete you will run: source db/schema.sql;
> - exit mysql by entering quit;
> 
> - last step is to run: npm start
>
